This assignment is to analyze standardize test results of student's math and reading scores across different schools.

Observable Trends:
-The dataset consists of a total of 15 schools, 39,170 students. The total students average reading score is 81.87 which is higher than the average math score 78.98. When we see the passing rate reading (85.80%) has a higher rate than math (74.98 %),the overall passing rate is 65.17%. These findings indicate that student's score more in reading than math.

-The school summary finding showed that from 15 schools 7 of them are found at the district level, and the other 8 of them found at the charter level. The number of students in schools ranged between 427 students to 4976 students.

-Students through grade 9 to 12 from each school had very similar grades overall and can be evident that the difference in age and grade does not affect the math or reading score.

Analysis:
-Based on the School and Student data and the devised statistic data and tables a couple of conclusions can be made by comparison.

-As shown in the Scores by School Spending Table, schools that spend less budget on each student seem to have better performance than schools that spend more money on each student.

-As shown in the Scores by School Size Table, there is a significant difference of school's performance between schools that have less than 2,000 students (small and medium sized) and more than 2,000 students (large sized). The bigger size schools tend to have lower performance.
